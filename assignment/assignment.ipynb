        "  What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "* Tidy datasets all have specific frameworks and messy datasets are all missing aspects of such frameworks\n",
        "* Different analyses of the same dataset evaluate multiple relationships between variables and require different definitions of the values within a table\n",

        "* Each observation forms a row\n",
        "* Each type of observational unit forms a table\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "* Column headers are values, not variable names\n",
        "* Multiple variables are stored in one column\n",
        "* Variables are stored in both rows and columns\n",
        "* Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table\n",
        "* A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables\n",
        "\n",
        " * The data is Table 4 has numbers as headings\n",
        "* Melting a dataset consists of turning columns into rows\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "* In table 11, the variables are stored in both the rows and columns (e.g. each day is spread across columns) but in table 12, the days, months, and year are concised into the date column and the tmax and tmin variables are given their own column instead of being contained within one column, \"element\"\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "* Want to improve the dataset by using better tidying tools, but innovating such tools is difficult as they must be tested on datasets already tidied by tidying tools\n"
